I'm working with a dataset that contains all of the International Football matches that have taken place since the 19th century. 
I'd like to use them to make some predictions about the 2018 World Cup, including each team's finish (based solely on historical data).
It contains way more data than I probably need (~40k rows, 8 columns), but doesn't include everything I need (notably World Cup finishes by year).
I'll likely have to join another dataset on it with some other info.
I've begun compiling team finishes by year, because I couldn't find a dataset that contains this information in a clear way.
I've begun engineering some of the features I'll need in Pandas, and thinking about how I'll score/operationalize different things.
I don't know enough to say what model I'll use for this, but looking forward to figuring it out in the next several classes!
